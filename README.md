# Portfolio 2

I was tasked with documenting three prior submissions in a Portfolio website.

These were the requirements:
- the title of the projects
- a description
- a screenshot of how the project looks when running,
- a link to the GitHub repo and a live site if it is online.

This site was made using:

React Vite & Tailwind css.


It includes:

Semester Project 2 - a website that displays blog posts.

Javascript Framework - a website that displays products with shopping cart.

Project Exam 2 - a social media website.
